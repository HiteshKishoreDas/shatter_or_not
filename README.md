* Create a directory "output" for this code to work.
* There are user defined globals in user_globals.h
* Run "./procedure" to remove pre-existing output files, heating rate file, term_output.txt file and compile the code.
* The numbers that show up during first run are heating rate and gridcell numbers printed when the heating rate file is written.
